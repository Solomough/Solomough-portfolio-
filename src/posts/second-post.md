# Out of Darkness into Light ✝️  

This post shares my journey of transformation — from confusion and hopelessness into a life of purpose, clarity, and impact.  

Through Christ, I discovered that life is not a struggle but a testimony of God’s wisdom and glory. Every project, every vision, every idea I now pursue flows from divine enlightenment.  

> “You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation…”  

That scripture reminds me daily that we are called out of darkness to manifest light in every sphere — including **technology**.
